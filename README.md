# DownloadsCleaner

successor to the downlaods to desktop sorter

this verison is run manually in the terminal, not automatically
this is to bypass the problem of moving temporary files
additional functionality is this version is the ability to change modes

modes
 - file
 - directory

both modes have the option to mark files/directories to be opted out from sorting
can move between modes
automatically detect which mode to enter, will automatically go to file mode at the beginning if available
if one mode is unavailable it will not switch
sorting scheme is still the same
files with an extension not found will be ignored
